== Flags

Reports allow users to flag content as objectionable (post or comment and author). Reports can be sent by users with the "Shark" badge (see API).

The numeric value `REASON` is used to distinguish between complaints:

1. Pornography
2. Pedophilia - any even remotely suggestive images/videos/texts with children or adolescents
3. Direct threat of violence
4. Illegal narcotics - any positive or promotion of illegal narcotics
5. Copyrighted content (with clear proof from the owner)


=== Conditions for creating a jury

Any flag can initiate the creation of a "jury". If the jury is initiated, all subsequent flags are ignored. To create a jury, the following rules are taken into account:

- The account in question is not in an active ban
- Number of flags with the same `REASON`, `CONTENT_TX_HASH` and `ADDRESS_HASH` must be `>= [main:20, test:5, reg:2]`
- Search depth for similar flags `FLAG_HEIGHT > (CURRENT_HEIGHT - [main:43200, test:4320, reg:10])`

== Jury

The jury is not a transaction, it is a record in the database and contains the following fields:

- `juryid` - Hash of the Flag that initiates the creation of the jury.
- `accountid` - Address of the account, the author of the content.
- `reason` - Numerical code of the reason for the complaint.

Together with the jury's entry, the moderators are selected:

- To filter the list of moderators, the transaction hash of the `FLAG_HASH` flag that initiated the creation of the jury is used.
- The hash of the moderator account registration transaction `ACCOUNT_HASH` is used as moderator sorting.
- To decide the jury's question, TM accounts `[main:80, test:6 reg:4]` are selected
- For an even distribution of moderators, accounts are selected according to the following conditions:
  * Selected TM/2 accounts where `ACCOUNT_HASH < FLAG_HASH`
  * Selected TM/2 accounts where `ACCOUNT_HASH > FLAG_HASH`


== Vote

The moderator's vote, which has two values `0|1` indicating whether the moderator agrees with the complaints or not. Any vote may initiate a jury verdict.

- The verdict is positive if the vote satisfies the condition that it is the Nth positive vote `[main:8, test:3, reg:2]`.
- A negative verdict is issued along with the first negative vote of any moderator.
- After a verdict (positive or negative) is passed, all votes are ignored.
- A jury without a verdict is indefinite.

`JURY_ID` - hash of the flag transaction that initiated the jury

`VERDICT` - numeric value `0|1`


== Ban Account

An account ban, like a jury, is not a transaction. It is a record in the database and contains the following fields:

- Link to the voice initiating the blocking.
- Link to the account, the author of the content.
- Height of the end of blocking. The blocking period is determined based on the rules:
  * First lock - `[main:43200, test:5000, reg:100]` blocks
  * Second lock - `[main:129600, test:10000, reg:200]` blocks
  * Third lock - `[main:51840000, test:15000, reg:1000]` blocks

An account blocked by a node is not allowed to create Social transactions, but can create monetary transactions without restrictions.

Other accounts have the right to perform actions with a blocked account (put ratings, comments, etc.).



== Rules for hiding content and accounts #In developing#

Accounts that are in the active jury, banned or have N active complaints should be hidden from the feed and search.
