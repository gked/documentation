= Network Setup Guide

In order for your node to receive incoming connections from the Bastyon front end and other nodes on the network, the following network ports must be open to your node: 8087, 37070, and 38081.

On home networks, enabling port forwarding is specific to your brand of internet router. For routers that support it, mapping to a different port should *not* be used, i.e. port external port 38081 should map to internal port 38081 on the router.  Below are links to instructions for some popular router models:
