You can find your reputation & related account restrictions by going to your Profile > Manage > Reputation.

Here you will find a list of your account limitations and your reputation.

You start at 0 and level up based on the star ratings you receive on your posts.

There are some limits. But as your reputation grows you can upvote more and more. This is done, so bots don't break down our blockchain.

Initially, you can make 5 posts, 5 videos, give out 15 ratings, 150 comments, and 300 comment ratings per 24 hours. This will increase every time your reputation increases at various milestones.

With my current reputation of 660, I can post 30 posts, 30 videos, give out 200 ratings, 300 comments, and 600 comment ratings per 24 hours.

We do have some limitations, but after testing it we have increased our limits. At the outset, you can make 15 posts and issue 100 ratings every 24 hours. Once your reputation grows above 50, you will be able to make up to 30 posts and 200 ratings every 24 hours.

Your reputation is the sum of your ratings calculated in the following way. Note, that users with reputations below 50 do not affect anyone's reputation or coin winnings. They can rate the content, but it does not affect reputation.

5=2
4=1
3=0
2=-1
1=-2

So, if you have two `5` star ratings and one `1` star rating, the total will be `2+2â€“2=2`

This will also determine your ability to be rate-limited for spam and other malicious activities. While I did not hit the limit of 15, on a new account after 10 or so ratings, I was told I had to wait 9 minutes for this all to be logged in the blockchain. Similar to Hive, new accounts have less available bandwidth to avoid spam. On my older account, I made 20 ratings back to back with no issues.

This is what a new account looks like and is limited to the actions it can perform on the blockchain.
