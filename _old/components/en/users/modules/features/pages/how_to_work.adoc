= How Does It Work On The Backend?
include::ROOT:partial$authors.adoc[tag=scottcbusiness]

Bastyon is modeled on the style of cryptocurrency (like Bitcoin and Ethereum), because it has no central authority and uses the blockchain to make transactions and ensure security.

There is no central server: instead, the platform relies on a network of nodes, located all over the world. Every person in the world with a computer can actually run a node (and be rewarded to do so).

Each post, each comment, each interaction (except chat messages!) is stored on the blockchain. This means that there is no way to remove a post or censor it. Every post is and will always be available on the blockchain and no authority, government or corporation can remove it.

Bastyon uses a dedicated blockchain, derived directly from the Bitcoin chain.
