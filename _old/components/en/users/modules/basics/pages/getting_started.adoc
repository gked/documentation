You can create an account with a username and image, and you will be given a passphrase and then you are able to start using Bastyon immediately. We will cover your keys and 12-words key passphrase later. You have the option to use an email though it isn’t needed nor linked to your profile.

After clicking “Join Now”, you may be prompted with a captcha, then you will be asked to pick from various themes you’d like to follow.

Then once you’re in Bastyon, you will be given you Private key. We will cover the importance of this later, but save it for now.

At the top left, you’ll also see the Bastyon logo with the language settings to the right of it in case you’d like to change to your preferred language.

You are now ready to begin.
