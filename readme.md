# Bastyon Overview

</div>

Hello and welcome to Bastyon! We're excited to have you here and hope this project will excite you as much as it excites us!

Bastyon is on a mission to democratize how people communicate. Today, most communication is centralized. It's not an overstatement to say that anyone can get unplugged from any platform for any reason, forcing them to lose their ability to communicate with loved ones, create content, or access their own data. Bastyon is changing this.

>Our vision is to create a resilient, decentralized ecosystem that empowers individuals with unrestricted access to communication, information, and personal data management. Our vision is to build a platform that stands strong against censorship and ensures user sovereignty in the digital realm.
