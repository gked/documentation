**Congratulations! You have launched an advertisement on Bastyon!**

## Content Creators

Bastyon believes that content creators should be well compensated for their work. A new advertising and monetization program for bloggers has been launched on the platform.

### How It Works

- Advertisers promote products or services on Bastyon
- Ads appear in the main feed and author channels
- Earnings from the main feed go to nodes
- Earnings from author channels go directly to the authors

### Participants and Payouts

- Initially, monetization works only on verified author channels
- Authors can disable monetization
- Channels with high activity will be included over time
- Channels outside Bastyon with over 1,000 subscribers can request verification via [email](mailto:support@bastyon.com)

> **IMPORTANT:** Authors earn proportionally to the activity and number of people on their channel. Higher engagement leads to higher payouts from the advertising pool.

### Earnings Withdrawal

Authors can withdraw PKOIN through exchanges like:
- [Tapbit.com](Tapbit.com)
- [Digifinex.com](Digifinex.com)
- [PKOIN.NET](https://pkoin.net)
- Peer-to-peer exchanges in various currencies

For withdrawal inquiries, contact [support@bastyon.com](mailto:support@bastyon.com).

### Payouts Calculation

Earnings vary based on:
- Amount of advertising in a given week
- Advertiser payments
- Channel activity (ratings and comments)

Active channels can earn the equivalent of $50-75 per week or more.

### Ways to Increase Earnings

- Create more content
- Invite more people to engage
- Focus on engagement under posts, not video length
